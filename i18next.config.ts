/**
 * i18next-cli workflow config for the whole monorepo.

 *   authored `en` catalogs under @fusion/i18n.
 * - `sync` propagates the `en` key structure to the four other locales.
 * - `types` regenerates key types from the `en` catalogs.
 * - `status` reports per-locale completion (CI gate).
 * - `lint` flags hardcoded user-facing strings (primary guardrail).
 *
 * Namespaces are routed by the `ns:` prefix in keys / `useTranslation(ns)` in
 * source, not by file path. `common` is the default namespace.
