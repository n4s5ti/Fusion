Prevent malformed task titles derived from assistant/tool confirmation prose (for example, `Created task **FN-1234** ...`) from being persisted as task titles. The triage finalization/recovery flow now also prefers canonical prompt headings (`# Task: FN-XXXX - Title`) when they match the task ID, so approved specs restore the intended human-readable title in metadata.
