Fix triage hangs when using pi-claude-cli with claude-sonnet-4-6. Parameterless custom tools (e.g. `fn_review_spec`) emit zero `input_json_delta` events from the Claude CLI, so the event bridge previously fell through to a raw empty-string fallback and pi's TypeBox validator rejected the call with "root: must be object" — looping the agent indefinitely. Defaults empty `partialJson` to `{}`. Also adds a reminder loop before the planning fallback model engages, propagates the bundled `@runfusion/fusion` extension into engine sessions so `fn_*` tools register without `pi install`, and drops the "historical" qualifier from replayed tool labels that was confusing models into treating their own prior turns as a previous session.
