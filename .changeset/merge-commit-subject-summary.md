Merge commits now get an AI-generated summary subject describing what changed (e.g. `feat(FN-XXXX): add user-invited webhook handler`) instead of the bare `feat(FN-XXXX): merge fusion/fn-XXXX`. The merger calls the existing `summarizeCommitSubject` lane alongside the body summarizer; on failure or when disabled, falls back to the legacy `merge <branch>` form.

Default for `useAiMergeCommitSummary` is now `true` (was `false`). Existing projects that haven't explicitly set the flag will pick up the new behavior on next start. The Settings UI already exposes the toggle.
