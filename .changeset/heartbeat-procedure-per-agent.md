Heartbeat prompts now re-anchor every tick on a Wake Delta + Heartbeat Procedure (paperclip-parity) so permanent agents stop silently grinding on prior tasks. Each tick the agent receives a structured wake delta (source, wake reason, assigned task, pending messages, triggering comments) and re-runs a 7-step procedure (identity → inbox → wake delta → assignment review → pick action → persist → exit) before continuing prior work.

The procedure is overridable per agent via a new `heartbeatProcedurePath` field pointing at a project-relative markdown file; the file is reloaded fresh each tick so operators can edit it live without restarting agents. New non-ephemeral agents default to `.fusion/HEARTBEAT.md`, and existing agents can be backfilled onto that path via `POST /api/agents/:id/upgrade-heartbeat-procedure` (also surfaced as an "Upgrade to Default Heartbeat Procedure" button in the agent detail Config tab). The default file is seeded from the built-in template on first use; subsequent edits are preserved.
