# FN-5048 Test-Speed Audit

## Scope and method
- Related baseline context:
  - `docs/test-audit-report.md` (prior workspace test audit baseline)
  - `docs/testing-suite-quality-prd.md` (suite quality taxonomy + priorities)
- Commands run (baseline):
  - `pnpm --filter @fusion/core exec vitest run --reporter=verbose --silent=passed-only`
  - `pnpm --filter @fusion/engine exec vitest run --reporter=verbose --silent=passed-only`
  - `pnpm --filter @runfusion/fusion exec vitest run --reporter=verbose --silent=passed-only`
  - `pnpm --filter @fusion/dashboard exec vitest run --reporter=verbose --silent=passed-only`
- Durations were derived from verbose per-test timing logs by aggregating milliseconds per test file and top `describe` groups.
- Classification rubric:
  - `delete`: low-signal/duplicate patterns from AGENTS.md “What NOT to write”.
  - `rewrite`: keep coverage, reduce cost via fake timers/seam narrowing/lighter fixtures/shared harness.
  - `keep`: high-signal regression/integration backstop.

## Baseline run totals
- `@fusion/core`: **26.29s** (pass)
- `@fusion/engine`: **93.29s** (pass)
- `@runfusion/fusion`: **13.90s** (pass)
- `@fusion/dashboard`: **359.52s** (`vitest run` across all dashboard projects; multiple unrelated pre-existing failures surfaced)

## Prioritized execution plan
1. **Dashboard SettingsModal + ChatView targeted rewrites** (largest projected wall-clock gain).
2. **Dashboard routes-auth focused narrowing** (`GET /auth/status` hotspot).
3. **CLI bin/extension test consolidation** (`it.each` + duplicate route-case reductions).
4. **Core watcher fake-timer rewrite** (`store-watcher.test.ts`).

## Keep-safe exclusions explicitly honored
- No edits to reliability-interaction tests under `packages/engine/src/__tests__/reliability-interactions/**`.
- No deletion of FN-tagged regression tests.
- No concurrency/worker-cap changes.

## Post-change results (Step 5 re-measure)
- Re-ran the same per-package verbose commands after landed trims/rewrites.
- Post-change totals:
  - `@fusion/core`: **23.08s** (pass)
  - `@fusion/engine`: **76.66s** (pass)
  - `@runfusion/fusion`: **9.40s** (pass)
  - `@fusion/dashboard`: **335.40s** (`vitest run` failed with broad pre-existing suite issues unrelated to FN-5048 edits)

### Targeted outcome checks for FN-5048 edits
- `packages/core/src/__tests__/store-watcher.test.ts` (`rewrite`): retained per-test harness and fake-timerized watch-active polling tests (`vi.useFakeTimers` before `watch`, `advanceTimersByTimeAsync` driving cycles); sampled isolated file runtime now ~1.8s total with watch-active cases no longer incurring 1–3s interval waits.
- `packages/cli/src/__tests__/bin.test.ts` (`rewrite`/`trim`): redundant route permutations consolidated with `it.each`; CLI suite passes.
- `AGENTS.md` standing rule added and cross-linked from this audit to prevent reintroduction of slow-test patterns.

### Acceptance note
- Edited files classified as `rewrite`/`delete` were retained with measurable local pass behavior in their packages.
- `@fusion/core` no-regression gate satisfied after harness correction (baseline **26.29s** → post-change **23.08s**).
- Dashboard lane remains unstable from pre-existing repository-level failures in planning/tracking/interview route tests and unrelated UI suites; no FN-5048 file changes were made in those failing areas.

## FN-5074 follow-up results
- Isolated re-measure after targeted rewrites (same command family used in FN-5074 preflight):
  - `routes-auth.test.ts`: **94.53s → 15.76s** (164 tests)
  - `routes-agents.test.ts`: **9.72s → 10.58s** in FN-5074, then **12.66s → 11.61s** in FN-5870 (348 tests in current isolated rerun; helper-driven route parity preserved)
  - `SettingsModal.test.tsx`: **43.40s → 48.60s** (438 tests; sampled rerun regressed due to remaining long-running device-code path)
  - `ChatView.test.tsx`: **12.53s → 14.66s** (390 tests; sampled rerun modestly higher while preserving coverage)
- FN-5074 preserved FN-tagged coverage and frozen-button assertions; all four files pass in isolation and full verification gates remained green in task execution.

## Notes
- Dashboard `vitest run` baseline and post-change measurements both surfaced broad failing suites outside this task’s implementation scope; timing evidence is still captured from the same command family.
- Standing prevention rule: see `AGENTS.md` → **Standing Rule: Do Not Add Slow Tests (FN-5048)**.
