# Test velocity baseline

> Weekly FN-6612 signal-per-second baseline. Measure and report feedback-loop velocity; do **not** add slow tests or wire this report into blocking PR checks. The merge gate remains the existing thin Lint, Typecheck, Build, and Gate path.

## Latest baseline

- Cycle: **2026-W26**
- Captured at: **2026-06-27T05:43:17.293Z**
- Timing snapshot: `scripts/test-timings.json` captured at **2026-06-27T05:41:42.568Z**
- Quarantine ledger: `scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json`

## Post to #leads

```text
FN-6612 weekly test velocity: gate 6.9s (-1.2s), boot smoke 18.0s (+436ms), pnpm test 13.7s (n/a), quarantine ledger 0 (0). Slowest file: packages/dashboard/src/__tests__/insights-routes.test.ts at 26.5s. Deletion-due quarantines: 0.
```

## How to refresh

```bash
pnpm test:velocity -- --measure --write-report
```

In measure mode, the script runs a non-measured `pnpm build` preflight before timing `pnpm test:gate`, `pnpm smoke:boot`, or `pnpm test`. The preflight time is setup only and is excluded from lane metrics; if it fails, the Measurement failures section records `Build preflight (pnpm build)` as the reason. Use `--skip-build-preflight` only when the workspace is already built by CI.

Report-only regeneration is cheap and does not run any suite:

```bash
pnpm test:velocity
```
