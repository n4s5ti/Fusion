/**
 * Characterization of SettingsModal's save-split (U9 / KTD-10).
 *
 * Pins the regression-critical behavior the redesign must preserve byte-for-byte:
 *   - one global + one project edit in a single session produce the expected
 *     `updateGlobalSettings` / `updateSettings` patches with strict scope routing;
 *   - clearing a project override emits null-as-delete;
 *   - untouched inherited project values are NOT written (changed-only gate);
 *   - explicit clears of global keys emit null, plain undefined is dropped.
 *
 * The split logic was lifted out of the modal into the pure `splitSettingsSave`
 * helper; this test exercises it against the real `@fusion/core` key predicates
 * so it stays honest about which keys land in which scope.
