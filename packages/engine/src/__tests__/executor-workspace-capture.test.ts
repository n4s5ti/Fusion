FNXC:Workspace 2026-06-21-23:30:
U1 per-repo capture + contamination + worktree-invariant tests (KTD1/KTD2). These drive the REAL TaskExecutor methods against a REAL two-repo git fixture under a NON-git workspace root (createWorkspaceFixture), so any leaked rootDir git preflight would actually fail and a hand-built `git diff` against an undefined base would blow up.

Seam choice (FN-5048): we set `(executor as any).workspaceConfig` directly (loadWorkspaceConfig has its own unit) and create real `fusion/<id>` worktrees per sub-repo with real commits — no mock-the-world child_process. Capture is exercised through `captureWorkspaceModifiedFiles` (the helper the post-session path at executor.ts:7900 calls) and verification through `verifyWorktreeInvariants`. Real git is used only where the invariant requires it.

Coverage:
- happy: edits in repo A + B → aggregated modifiedFiles carry repo-prefixed paths from BOTH, each diffed against its own baseCommitSha.
- edge: a repo with baseCommitSha undefined → capture still works via resolveDiffBaseRef's merge-base fallback (no `git diff undefined..HEAD`).
- contamination: a foreign commit (feat(FN-OTHER):) in a sub-repo's range → the filterFilesToOwnTaskCommits divergence audit fires (task:worktree-contamination-detected) for that repo, and the foreign file is excluded from attributed files.
- error: a worktree HEAD off fusion/<id> → verifyWorktreeInvariants returns {ok:false, reason:'wrong_branch', repo, observed, expected} (NOT {ok:true}); the reason enum is preserved for the :10889 consumer.
- regression: a single-repo (non-workspace) task → capture/verify identical to today.
