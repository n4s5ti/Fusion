/**
 * FN-4811 reliability backstop: `cleanupConflictingWorktree` and `handleBranchConflict`
 * must refuse to force-remove a worktree that is currently bound to an active executor
 * session (in-memory map or DB-level in-progress task). Without this guard, FN-4546
 * stale-active-branch reclaim, branch-conflict recovery, or startup cleanup paths can
 * yank the filesystem out from under a live agent — producing the FN-4781/FN-4804
 * cascade: "assigned worktree path disappeared mid-task", two parallel runs alive
 * simultaneously, and cross-task contamination.
 *
 * The canonical guards live in `executor.ts`:
 *   - `findActiveWorktreeOwner(path, requestingTaskId)`
 *   - liveness short-circuit at top of `cleanupConflictingWorktree`
 *   - liveness short-circuit at top of `handleBranchConflict`
