  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-14-01:36:
  The full @runfusion/fusion package lane times out or leaks mock state across these CLI integration-heavy files under changed-test load, while the same files pass in smaller direct runs.
  Quarantine them per the flaky-test deletion ratchet instead of raising the 5s test timeout or relaxing assertions.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-14-01:45:
  The next full changed-test run exposed five more CLI files that time out only under package-wide load after the dashboard and desktop lanes, and the same five files passed together in a direct run.
  Keep excluding load-sensitive offenders from the default CLI lane until their shared fixture and cleanup races are fixed.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-14-01:48:
  Re-running the CLI package lane after that quarantine exposed another batch of package-load-only timeouts in extension, goal-store, registration, and init tests.
  These files also passed together in a direct run, so keep applying the deletion-ratchet quarantine instead of increasing global CLI timeouts.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-14-01:58:
  mission.test includes a real temp-project end-to-end mission-goal case that exceeds the default 5s CLI timeout even as a standalone targeted run, then passes only when given 30s.
  Quarantine the slow file rather than encoding a longer timeout into the default package lane.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-13-20:05:
  FN-6421 quarantines the remaining FN-6419 CLI lane offenders after standalone evidence showed the agent-provisioning and serve suites pass directly but are integration-heavy under package-wide load.
  Keep them on the 14-day deletion clock rather than widening CLI test timeouts or loosening assertions.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-14-05:50:
  FN-6427 triaged all 24 quarantined CLI files and kept them in-window: 0 rescued, 0 deleted, 24 kept until the 2026-06-27 and 2026-06-28 deletion deadlines.
  Fresh direct runs passed, and the shared package-load signature needs a broader fixture/concurrency rescue before these high-value suites can safely rejoin the default lane.
