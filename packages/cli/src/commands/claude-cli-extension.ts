/**
 * Resolver for the vendored `@fusion/pi-claude-cli` pi extension.
 *
 * `@fusion/pi-claude-cli` is a workspace package at `packages/pi-claude-cli/`,
 * a soft fork of rchern/pi-claude-cli (see that package's UPSTREAM.md). It
 * ships its extension entry as raw `.ts` source — pi's loader compiles TS on
 * the fly via jiti, so we just need to point pi at the right file.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT auto-add "npm:@fusion/pi-claude-cli" to the user's
 * ~/.fusion/agent/settings.json packages array. The package is resolved from
 * this workspace at runtime and loaded explicitly only when
 * GlobalSettings.useClaudeCli is true — this avoids polluting user-owned
 * config files and lets us gate the extension on a UI toggle without
 * settings.json churn.
