## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- ae90be0: Bundle workspace packages into CLI for npm publish. The published package previously declared dependencies on private `@kb/core`, `@kb/dashboard`, and `@kb/engine` workspace packages, causing `npm install` to fail. Switched the CLI build from `tsc` to `tsup` (esbuild) to inline all `@kb/*` workspace code into a single bundled `dist/bin.js`, while keeping third-party packages (`express`, `multer`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`) as external dependencies. Dashboard client assets are now copied into `dist/client/` so the published tarball is fully self-contained.
- 28bbcb9: Exclude Bun-compiled platform binaries from npm publish tarball, reducing package size significantly.
