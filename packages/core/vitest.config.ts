  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-13-17:43:
  The full workspace suite must not fail on suite-load-sensitive tests that pass standalone or only fail after excessive wall time. Quarantine observed core offenders after package-lane hook timeouts instead of appeasing them with wider hook timeouts.

  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-14-02:14:
  FN-6433 re-ran the core quarantine batch after FN-6430's shared fixture cleanup and rescued all five files without timeout or assertion changes. Keep this array empty unless a future quarantine is mirrored in scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json in the same commit.

  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-15-03:13:
  FN-6481 observed the disk-backed concurrent write test fail in the changed-package workspace lane with a transient SQLite BEGIN IMMEDIATE lock after the gate had already passed. Quarantine the flaky file instead of widening lock-recovery timeouts or weakening assertions.

  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-15-07:39:
  FN-6486 rescued store-concurrent-writes by making the transient lock helper release independent of event-loop timer scheduling, then removed the quarantine in lockstep with scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json. Keep this array empty unless a future observed flake is mirrored in the ledger in the same commit.

  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-17-17:21:
  FN-6596 verification observed task-list-format and test-project timing out only in the broad changed-package core lane after the merge gate had passed; both files passed immediate isolated reruns. Quarantine the suite-load flakes without widening timeouts or weakening assertions.

  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-17-17:55:
  FN-6592 rescued mission-integration by closing every reopened TaskStore handle and strengthening restart-fidelity assertions across mission hierarchy read paths. Keep the quarantine absent in both this exclude list and scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json unless a future observed flake is mirrored in both files.

  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-17-19:03:
  FN-6600 re-ran the core quarantine candidates under the broad-run worker budget and rescued the current core ledger entries without timeout, retry, assertion, or worker-budget appeasement.
  Keep core quarantines mirrored here only when a loaded run still fails after shared teardown cleanup has been ruled out.

  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-19-10:00:
  FN-6705 verification observed these five files fail only in the broad changed-package core lane with hook/test timeouts, ENOTEMPTY cleanup, or a missed deferred hook after the same files passed an immediate targeted rerun. Quarantine the suite-load flakes instead of widening timeouts, adding retries, or weakening assertions.

  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-19-10:24:
  FN-6705 verification then observed settings-export time out in beforeEach only under the broad changed-package core lane while the targeted file rerun passed in 5.1s. Quarantine the suite-load hook flake instead of increasing hookTimeout.

  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-19-14:31:
  FN-6741 reloaded the six 2026-06-19 core quarantine files under the broad @fusion/core lane and rescued them in lockstep with scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json. Keep this array empty; future core suite-load flakes must prove a remaining shared worker-root/temp-redirect or fixture close-order gap before re-quarantining.

  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-19-15:05:
  Merge verification for FN-6741 observed store-concurrent-writes fail again under the broad @fusion/core lane with SQLite BEGIN IMMEDIATE lock exhaustion. Re-quarantine that single suite-load lock flake in lockstep with the ledger; keep the other rescued core files loaded.

  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-20-05:19:
  FN-6790 found no task-documents quarantine half-state on HEAD and rescued the ENOENT-rename class by quiescing deferred task-created write/hook work on TaskStore.close(). Keep task-documents loaded; do not add a ledger/config exclude unless a new loaded run fails after this lifecycle seam is ruled out.
