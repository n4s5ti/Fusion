  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-13-17:43:
  The full workspace suite must not fail on suite-load-sensitive tests that pass standalone or only fail after excessive wall time. Quarantine observed core offenders after package-lane hook timeouts instead of appeasing them with wider hook timeouts.

  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-14-02:14:
  FN-6433 re-ran the core quarantine batch after FN-6430's shared fixture cleanup and rescued all five files without timeout or assertion changes. Keep this array empty unless a future quarantine is mirrored in scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json in the same commit.

  FNXC:CoreTests 2026-06-15-03:13:
  FN-6481 observed the disk-backed concurrent write test fail in the changed-package workspace lane with a transient SQLite BEGIN IMMEDIATE lock after the gate had already passed. Quarantine the flaky file instead of widening lock-recovery timeouts or weakening assertions.
