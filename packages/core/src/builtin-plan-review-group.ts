FNXC:PlanReviewStep 2026-06-28-23:29:
The default Coding workflow needs an optional plan review before a task crosses from planning into execution. Model it as a DEFAULT-ON `optional-group` so operators get the same per-task toggle semantics as Code Review: enabled tasks review PROMPT.md before `parse-steps`, and disabled tasks pass through directly to execution.

export const PLAN_REVIEW_GROUP_ID = "plan-review";

/** Inner template node id — distinct from the group id (template-node-id collision rule, U1). */
export const PLAN_REVIEW_STEP_NODE_ID = "plan-review-step";

const PLAN_REVIEW_NAME = "Plan Review";

const PLAN_REVIEW_DESCRIPTION =
  "Review the task plan before execution for missing requirements, unsafe scope, and unclear implementation steps";

const PLAN_REVIEW_PROMPT = `You are a senior plan reviewer. Review the task's PROMPT.md before implementation starts.

## Step 1: Read the plan
1. Read PROMPT.md and any task context the plan cites.
2. Confirm the plan captures the user's current requirements, expected workflow, file scope, and verification path.

## Review focus
1. **Requirement coverage** — missing user requirements, changed requirements, acceptance criteria, or workflow constraints.
2. **Execution clarity** — vague steps, missing ordering/dependencies, or steps that cannot be executed by the coding agent.
3. **Scope control** — unsafe expansion, missing file-scope boundaries, or contradictions with project instructions.
4. **Verification quality** — absent or weak tests/checks for the behavior being changed.
5. **Risk callouts** — migrations, data-loss paths, external integrations, secrets, or plugin/runtime dependencies that need explicit handling.

Be specific: cite the plan section or file path for every finding and explain the concrete correction.

## Output Requirements
- APPROVE: the plan is ready for execution.
- APPROVE_WITH_NOTES: execution may proceed, but include non-blocking advisory notes.
- REVISE: the plan should be corrected before execution; include the missing or wrong requirement and the needed change.
- Final output: output exactly one trailing JSON object on the final line (no markdown fences, no surrounding prose):
{"verdict":"APPROVE|APPROVE_WITH_NOTES|REVISE","notes":"..."}`;
