/**
 * Per-task EFFECTIVE workflow-settings resolution (U3, R3, KTD-3).
 *
 * Sibling of `workflow-ir-resolver.ts`. Composes three steps into the flat,
 * `Partial<ProjectSettings>`-shaped value map the engine reads at executor entry:
 *
 *   1. resolve the workflow IR (built-in or custom) → its `settings` declarations;
 *   2. read the raw stored `(workflowId, projectId)` value map;
 *   3. {@link resolveEffectiveSettingValues} → declaration default ?? stored value,
 *      dropping orphaned/invalid stored entries (KTD-6).
 *
 * The moved keys are all current `ProjectSettings` fields, so the returned map is a
 * structurally-compatible `Partial<ProjectSettings>` today. The engine MERGES this
 * over the project/global settings object so the ~20 flat `settings.<key>` read
 * sites keep their exact expressions (KTD-3).
 *
 * NEVER-THROW contract (mirrors the IR resolver): a missing/corrupt workflow
 * degrades to the built-in coding declarations; any store error degrades to an
 * empty stored map, so the result falls back to declaration defaults. The caller
 * always receives a usable map.
 *
 * IMPORTANT (parity): for built-in workflows with no stored values the effective
 * map carries the declaration defaults, which are byte-equal to the legacy
 * `DEFAULT_PROJECT_SETTINGS` literals — so merging it over project settings is a
 * no-op when nothing is customized. Keys whose declaration omits a default (the
 * per-phase model lanes) are ABSENT from the map (never `undefined`), so the merge
 * never clobbers a real project value with `undefined`.

/**

 *
 *  - a STORED key ALWAYS overrides the project/global base (the workflow tuned it);
 *  - a default-only key (in `effective` but NOT in `storedKeys`) only FILLS the
 *    base when the base lacks the key.
 *
 * This is what makes U3 behavior-identical pre-migration: a customized project
 * setting (still present in the base before the U4 hard-move) is NOT clobbered by a
 * declaration default; only a real stored workflow value overrides it. Post-
 * migration the base lacks the moved key, so the declaration default fills it.
