# Project Guidelines

## Essential rules

### Spec Generation Hygiene

- Do not cite `.fusion/tasks/<id>/<file>` paths in Context/Steps/File Scope unless the file already exists, is explicitly created as a `(new)` Artifact, or is sibling `PROMPT.md`/`task.json`/`attachments/*`.
- Dangling task-local file references are a blocking spec REVISE.
- Save planning scratch and interim notes via `fn_task_document_write` instead of inventing on-disk task-local files.

#### External-integration evidence

Any task integrating a third-party tool (CLI, daemon, downloadable binary, installer-managed dependency) must cite, in PROMPT.md:
1. Canonical upstream repo URL.
2. Docs/homepage URL.
3. Release/download URL.
4. Binary/CLI name in backticks.
5. Checksum or `upstream-pending-verification` marker.

Missing evidence is a blocking REVISE. Never invent release URLs, binary names, or hashes.

### Finalizing Changes

When a change affects published `@runfusion/fusion`, add a changeset (example: `.changeset/<name>.md` with `"@runfusion/fusion": patch`).

Bump types:
- **patch** — bug fixes/internal
- **minor** — new features/CLI/tools
- **major** — breaking changes

Do **NOT** create changesets for AGENTS.md/README/internal docs, CI config, or behavior-preserving refactors. `@fusion/core`, `@fusion/dashboard`, and `@fusion/engine` are private.

### Releasing

Use only:

```bash
pnpm release --yes
```

`scripts/release.mjs` is the source of truth. Do not substitute with manual `changeset version`, `pnpm publish`, or git tags.

### Package Structure

- `@fusion/core` — domain model/task store (private)
- `@fusion/dashboard` — web UI + API server (private)
- `@fusion/engine` — triage/executor/reviewer/merger/scheduler (private)
- `@runfusion/fusion` — CLI + pi extension (published)

Only `@runfusion/fusion` is published; `@fusion/*` packages are bundled into it.

#### Importing across `@fusion/*` packages

`@fusion/*` imports must be statically analyzable. Anti-pattern:

```ts
const engineModule = "@fusion/engine";
const engine = await import(/* @vite-ignore */ engineModule);
```

Rules:
1. Default to static imports.
2. `@fusion/core` uses DI (`setCreateFnAgent`) instead of dynamic `import("@fusion/engine")` due to circularity.
3. Never reintroduce the `engineModule = "@fusion/engine"` trick.
4. `vi.mock("@fusion/engine", ...)` remains valid.

### Testing commands

The merge gate is thin and trusted: CI blocks PRs on exactly Lint, Typecheck, Build, and Gate (boot smoke + `pnpm test:gate`). Everything else runs non-blocking in `full-suite.yml` on push to main. A red gate means a real problem; a red non-blocking run is information, not a merge stopper. Typechecks/manual checks are not substitutes for the gate.

```bash
pnpm test          # gate suite + changed-only affected tests (bounded; never full-suite)
pnpm test:gate     # the merge gate: curated engine-core suite + CI-shape test
pnpm smoke:boot    # boot smoke: CLI --help + real serve /api/health
pnpm test:full     # full workspace suite — explicit opt-in only
pnpm lint
pnpm build
pnpm verify:workspace  # deep opt-in verification (lint -> test:full -> build); NOT the merge gate
```

### Standing Rule: Flaky Tests Are Quarantined on Sight (Deletion Ratchet)

- A test observed failing without a corresponding real bug in the change is QUARANTINED ON SIGHT: add an entry to `scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json` (`file`, `reason` with a link to the failing run, `quarantinedAt`) AND a matching one-line `exclude` in that package's vitest config, in the same commit.
- **Agents must never appease a flaky test.** No widened timeouts, no added retries, no loosened or deleted assertions to make a flake pass. Quarantine it instead. Appeasement drains the test's signal and is how the suite rotted last time.
- A quarantined test is DELETED after 14 days (`quarantinedAt` + 2 weeks) unless rescued. Rescue requires evidence the test catches real regressions plus a root-cause fix — not stabilization passes.
- A flake INSIDE the merge gate is evicted, not skipped: remove its line from the `engine-core` allow-list in `packages/engine/vitest.config.ts` (the eviction PR does not need the flaky test to pass).
- A second quarantine in the same subsystem is a product-race smell — look at the product code before the deletion clock runs out (see `docs/solutions/ui-bugs/skill-autocomplete-highlight-reset-on-swr-revalidation.md`: a flake "stabilized" three times was a real race).
- Gate admission requires evidence of value; tests never graduate into the gate by default. Mechanics: `docs/testing.md` → "Quarantine ledger and the deletion ratchet".

### Standing Rule: Do Not Add Slow Tests (FN-5048)

- Prefer narrow seams, in-memory fakes, shared harnesses, and targeted assertions.
- Prefer fake timers over real polling/time waits.
- Do not mask slowness by raising worker/concurrency knobs.
- Do not add new real-network calls, real polling loops, or mock-the-world shells when a narrower seam exists.
- Use the testing taxonomy in `docs/testing.md` when deciding trim vs keep.

### Standing Rule: Fix the Invariant, Not the Repro (FN-5893)

- When fixing a bug, the regression test must assert the general invariant across ALL known surfaces — not only the single reported reproduction.
- Symptom-based acceptance is mandatory for bug-class tasks: the final verification must reproduce the original failure condition and assert it no longer occurs via a real automated test. Encode this as a `## Symptom Verification` section in PROMPT.md with **Original symptom**, **Exact reproduction**, and **Assertion it is gone**; green build/tests alone are insufficient. This marker is the contract consumed by the GitHub auto-close gate (FN-6230).
- Surface enumeration is now an enforced bug-fix artifact: the spec must include a `## Surface Enumeration` section, planning must REVISE when that section is missing, and review must REVISE any repro-only regression test.
- The Surface Enumeration gate also applies to tasks that add or remove UI affordances (icons, buttons, chevrons, toggles, badges, menu entries, click targets), including Review Level 0 cosmetic tasks.
- Enumerate the surfaces before filing or closing the fix: every provider/bridge for streaming and agent paths, both desktop and mobile breakpoints for UI behavior, empty/undefined/duplicate/populated data states, and every shared hook/component/module/helper that reuses the affected logic.
- After removing a UI affordance, explicitly check for and clean up empty button shells, orphaned click targets, now-unused wrappers, and dangling aria-labels across both desktop and mobile breakpoints.
- Use the canonical checklist in `docs/testing.md` → **Surface Enumeration checklist** so planning and review enumerate the same surfaces.
- Motivating incidents: streamed-response spacing was fixed three times before the invariant was fully covered (FN-5787, FN-5789, FN-5803), the usage "Show hidden" button regressed three times before broader coverage stuck (FN-5797, FN-5875, FN-5919), and the auto-merge blank-dashboard fix re-opened after desktop-only coverage missed mobile Android (FN-5751).
- Motivating incident for UI affordances: the workflow-row drop-down arrow removal took three tasks (FN-6115 → FN-6118 → FN-6123) because the affordance rendered in two components and mobile kept an empty 36×36 `btn-icon` button shell.
- If a regression test only proves the exact reported case, it is incomplete; extend it until the invariant holds across all known surfaces.

### Port 4040 is Reserved

Never kill processes on port 4040 and never start test servers on 4040. Use `--port 0` or another free port.

### Never run an unbounded `find` against the system temp directory

Do not issue a recursive `find` (or any unbounded recursive directory walk) rooted at the OS temp directory — `$TMPDIR`, `/tmp`, or macOS `/var/folders/...` (canonical `/private/var/...`). The temp root can hold an enormous number of entries on CI and long-lived dev hosts, so a broad scan can hang for minutes and pin I/O.

When you need a Fusion temp artifact, target the known prefix directly and list a single level with a prefix filter — never walk the whole temp tree. The canonical bounded pattern is the engine's own sweep: non-recursive `readdirSync(...)` passes over the configured `<worktreesDir>/.ai-merge/` root plus legacy `.fusion/ai-merge/` and `tmpdir()` leftovers, filtered by a known prefix such as `fusion-ai-merge-` (`SelfHealingManager.cleanupStaleTempMergeWorktrees()` in `packages/engine/src/self-healing.ts`). Scoped `find` calls under a project worktree or `.fusion/` are fine; only the broad temp-root scan is forbidden.

### Engine Process Rules

#### Never use `execSync` for user-configured commands

Run user-configured commands (test/build/workflow scripts) via async `exec` with timeout. `execSync` is only acceptable for short deterministic git plumbing.

#### Move-Task contract

User `moveTask(in-progress → todo)` is a hard cancel: abort active sessions/subprocesses and park task in `todo` with user-paused semantics. Engine rebounds must not set `userPaused`.

#### Process supervision

Use `superviseSpawn(...)` from `@fusion/core` for managed child processes; do not use raw detached `spawn`/`nohup` patterns unless explicitly allowlisted. `eslint.config.mjs` + `scripts/check-no-nohup.mjs` enforce this.

### Git Conventions

- Commit prefixes: `feat(FN-XXX):`, `fix(FN-XXX):`, `test(FN-XXX):`
- One commit per step boundary
- Include task ID prefix
- Fusion task-worktree commits should carry `Fusion-Task-Id: FN-NNNN` trailers

### Merging Branches Into Main

1. **Drop duplicate commits before merging.** Rebase away duplicates already on main.
2. **Squash is now the project default; history-preserving merge paths require opt-in.** New projects default `directMergeCommitStrategy="always-squash"`. To preserve multi-commit history, explicitly set project `directMergeCommitStrategy` to `"auto"` or `"always-rebase"`, or set a per-task `**Direct Merge Commit Strategy:** ...` override in `PROMPT.md`.
3. **Empty cherry-picks are no-ops.** Do not create empty commits.
4. **Already-on-main classifier applies.** Allow finalize/self-healing recovery when lineage is landed.
5. **Contamination auto-recovery is bounded.** First pass can auto-drop upstream foreign commits; repeated/ambiguous cases escalate.
6. **Run post-squash audit policy.** Respect `postMergeAuditMode` (`warn`/`block`/`off`) and auto-recovery stages.
7. **Enforce pre-commit diff-volume gate.** Block suspicious shrinkage before squash commit.
8. **Smart-prefer-main overlap guard.** Recent overlapping main commits can flip to prefer-branch.
9. **Layer-3 scope partition.** Out-of-scope conflicts resolve to main before AI arbitration unless `task.scopeOverride=true`.
10. **Auto-prerebase on divergence/hot files.** Fail-soft and continue normal conflict stack.

### Gitignored-path guard on squash merges

Never force-add ignored artifacts (for example `git add -f .fusion/...`). Use task documents for findings/notes.

### File-Scope invariant on squash merges

Every squash commit must overlap task `## File Scope` (unless scope is empty). Violations must fail with `FileScopeViolationError` and reset pre-squash state.

Per-task opt-out exists: `task.scopeOverride = true` (log the reason).

### `autoMerge: false` callout (FN-5147)

When `settings.autoMerge: false`, `in-review` is terminal-until-merged by a human. Lifecycle-mutating self-healing must not move these tasks backward, pause/fail them, or re-enqueue them for execution.

Scoped exception (FN-5819): shared-branch-group members (`branchContext.assignmentMode === "shared"`) still run the member→shared-branch local integration step while auto-merge is off. This exception is only for assembling `branch_groups.branchName`; shared-branch → default-branch promotion remains gated by group/global auto-merge.

### Mock provider (test mode)

`testMode?: boolean` is now available in both project and global settings. If project `testMode === true` (or the resolved default provider is `"mock"` at any tier), every AI lane is forced to `mock/scripted`, overriding per-task and per-lane model selections. The dashboard exposes this via the Settings Modal "Enable test mode" toggle and a persistent "Test mode — no real AI calls" banner.

### Run Audit

- FN-5419: git run-audit now includes `pull:fast-forward` and `stash:pop-conflict`; dashboard git surfaces now include the extended `POST /api/git/pull` integration-worktree path plus companion `POST /api/git/stash-resolve`, `POST /api/git/stash-drop`, and `POST /api/git/stash-apply` routes.
- FN-6292: self-healing emits `task:reconcile-dependency-blocking-lease` when it rebounds an in-progress holder whose stale file-scope lease blocks an unmet dependency, and `task:reconcile-dependency-blocking-lease-no-action` when triple-proof blocks that backward move.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Dolt-powered version control with native sync
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update <id> --claim --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task atomically**: `bd update <id> --claim`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs via Dolt:

- Each write auto-commits to Dolt history
- Use `bd dolt push`/`bd dolt pull` for remote sync
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

For more details, see README.md and docs/QUICKSTART.md.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
